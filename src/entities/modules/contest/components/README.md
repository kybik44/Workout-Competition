Use the `<MyImage />` component if all conditions are met:

-   many images on one gallery page
-   images on the page take up a lot of height space

how to use:

-   pass the src of the image to the component
-   inside the component, configure it as needed (the link to the props for costomization is inside)

if the content takes up little space in height use `<img loading='lazy'>`
